The advantages to the PSC Team are that we can guarantee a high level of UAT and adopter input.  The advantage for adopters is of course funding for their time.  The disadvantage for adopters is that their workload increases dramatically over voluntary participation.</td><td>We will continue to work with our elaborators to produce quality software regardless of a funded adoption program.  </td><td>External</td></tr><tr><td>694</td><td>CTMS Developer Study Calendar Module - Phase II</td><td>Requirements </td><td>Requirements of CTMSi Bundle project may or may not align with PSC adopter requirements.
