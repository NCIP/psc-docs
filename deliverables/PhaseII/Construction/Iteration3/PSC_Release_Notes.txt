                      1.0 Patient Study Calendar Introduction
================================================================

   
    This document contains the release notes for the second phase of Patient Study Calendar, version 1.3.  

    Patient Study Calendar is an open source, standards-compliant software application that can be used by organizations that manage patient activities on cancer clinical trials. Patient Study Calendar supports the application of a study template to study participants and enables the prospective forecasting of participant activities.  It also provides a framework for reviewing historical study calendar events. Patient Study Calendar records modifications to a participant's schedule and enables access control to the application across a multi-site environment.  
    The Patient Study Calendar application is intended to be installed on a single server at a coordinating cancer center and accessed by any number of clients via a web browser.  

    This release of Patient Study Calendar supports caBIG Silver Level Compatibility.

    The test site for Patient Study Calendar is hosted at :

To leverage design work already implemented by the caAERS and C3PR projects as well as present a more consistent look and feel across the applications within the CTMS workspace, we have adopted a similar look and feel for PSC.

    2.  Select and manage arbitrary scheduled activities
In a patient's calendar, any number of activities may be selected and rescheduled, canceled, or marked as complete.

    3.  Add reconsent to patient calendars
For a given study, add a reconsent activity to each patient's schedule.

    4.  Conditional activities

Cancel the remaining activities for a patient as of a specified date.

    6.  Template amendments
Create updated versions of a study template.

    7.  Real-world scheduling

    8.  User provisioning
PSC now provides user provisioning interfaces, eliminating the need for users to install a separate User Provisioning Tool.
