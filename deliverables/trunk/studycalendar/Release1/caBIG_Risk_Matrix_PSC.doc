</tr><tr><td>507</td><td>Study Calendar Module</td><td>Requirements </td><td>It is unclear at this point in time who will be the ultimate adopters of the patient study calendar application. Having at least one committed adopter during the development cycle is critical to the success of the overall effort.</td><td>2 = approximately 50% (chances are even that risk will occur in next 30 days)</td><td>(P) Profound</td><td>(PND) Pending</td><td>Although we still do not have funded adopters, we have several sites who have expressed interest in adopting and advising the requirements gathering process.  These sites include the Mayo Clinic and Dartmouth.  We have an email listserv and weekly meetings with these possible adopters to be sure that our development efforts meet their expectations.
